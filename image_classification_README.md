# Image Classification Tool

This tool classifies images based on their content.

## Features

-   [Describe key feature 1, e.g., Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP)]
-   [Describe key feature 2, e.g., Allows batch processing of images]
-   [Describe key feature 3, e.g., Outputs results in JSON format]
-   Uses a pre-trained model: [Specify model architecture, e.g., ResNet50, VGG16, Custom CNN]
-   [Mention if fine-tuning is supported or if it uses a specific dataset]

## Dependencies

List the primary dependencies required to run this tool:

-   **Programming Language**: [e.g., Python 3.7+]
-   **Core Libraries**:
    -   [e.g., TensorFlow 2.x / PyTorch 1.x]
    -   [e.g., NumPy]
    -   [e.g., Pillow / OpenCV for image processing]
-   **Other Packages**:
    -   [e.g., scikit-learn for metrics]
    -   [List any other specific Python packages]
-   **System Level Dependencies** (if any):
    -   [e.g., CUDA Toolkit for GPU acceleration]

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the tool on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd [repository-directory]
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    [Provide specific command, e.g., using a requirements file]
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Or, if dependencies are listed manually:
    ```bash
    pip install [package1] [package2] ...
    ```

4.  **Download pre-trained model weights (if applicable):**
    [Provide instructions, e.g., "Download the model weights from [link-to-model-weights] and place them in the './models' directory."]
    [Alternatively, mention if the script downloads them automatically]

5.  **Set up environment variables (if any):**
    [e.g., "Set `MODEL_PATH` to point to your model directory."]

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can use the tool as follows:

1.  **Command-line execution:**
    [Provide example command with placeholder arguments]
    ```bash
    python classify_image.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg [other-arguments]
    ```
    Example:
    ```bash
    python main_classifier.py --input_image assets/sample_image.png --model_name ResNet50
    ```

2.  **Expected output:**
    [Describe what the user should expect to see, e.g., "The script will output the predicted class label and the confidence score."]
    Example output:
    ```
    Predicted Class: Cat
    Confidence: 0.95
    ```

3.  **Using as a library (if applicable):**
    [Provide a code snippet if the tool can be imported and used in other Python scripts]

## Configuration

[Describe how users can configure the tool, if applicable.]
-   Model parameters (e.g., image size, batch size) can be adjusted in `config.yaml` or via command-line arguments.
-   [Mention other configurable aspects, e.g., threshold for classification confidence.]

## Training (Optional)

This section is relevant if the tool supports training or fine-tuning models.

1.  **Dataset Preparation:**
    [Describe how to prepare the dataset, e.g., "Organize images into subdirectories named after their classes under the `./dataset/train` and `./dataset/val` folders."]

2.  **Training Script:**
    [Provide the command to run the training script]
    ```bash
    python train_model.py --data_dir ./dataset --epochs 50 --learning_rate 0.001
    ```

3.  **Monitoring Training:**
    [Mention tools for monitoring, e.g., "Training progress can be monitored using TensorBoard."]

## Testing

To ensure the tool is working correctly, run the provided tests:

1.  **Navigate to the project directory.**
2.  **Execute the test suite:**
    [Provide the command to run tests, e.g.]
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover tests
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
